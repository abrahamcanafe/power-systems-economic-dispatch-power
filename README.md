# Optimal Economic Dispatch Linear Program
Linear program that simulates the optimal economic dispatch over a 24-hour horizon for a local power system with hydroelectric generators. The final project written 2022 for my Power Systems Economics class.

## Built With

* Written in MATLAB
* Utilizes the YALMIP toolbox

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Project Details

Information from the power system model diagrammed in `Course Project.xlsx` was used to write a linear program (LP) for optimal economic dispatch.

The following data were considered when writing the LP:
* Hydroelectric unit capacity limits: minimum and maximum power, startup costs, duty factors (cfs/MWh)
* Reservoir elevation limits
* Locational marginal prices over a 24-hour horizon
